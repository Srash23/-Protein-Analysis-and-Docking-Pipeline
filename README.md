This pipeline is an integrated suite of bioinformatics tools specifically designed to enhance and simplify the study of protein structures and functions. This pipeline facilitates comprehensive analysis of protein sequences, from prediction and parametrization to structural alignments, visualization of binding pockets, preparing files for docking, and providing blind docking, between a protein and ligand of interest, supporting a wide range of biochemical and molecular biology research objectives. Utilizing ESMfold, the pipeline predicts the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences. Through Protparam, the pipeline calculates various properties of the protein sequences such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, aromaticity, and instability index. Clustal-W is employed to align multiple protein sequences, enabling the identification of conserved regions and structural motifs. The pipeline also includes tools like fPockets to identify and visualize potential active sites or ligand-binding regions in the protein structures. It also includes converting .pdb files and .sdf files, into suitable formats for running small-molecular blind docking using AutoDock Vina.
